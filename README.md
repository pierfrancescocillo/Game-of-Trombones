# Game ofTrombones
## Web-based Game for practicing and memorizing the position of the notes playable by a Trombone in terms of position of the slider and level of insufflation pressure

**INSERT IMAGE**

As a project for the Computer Music: Representation and Models course we decided to develope a web-based didactic tool, which emulates the playing pattern of a Trombone. We did it putting the playable notes in a table with the horizontal position of the main slide of the Trombone on the horizontal axis, and the insufflation pressure on the vertical axis, growing downwards.

The user can create a list of the notes he want to practice to play, and then... let the games begin!

## Game mode

By using the **Settings** Interface, the user can set some parameters to customize the game. He, or she, che choose the difficulty of the game, between *Easy*
, *Medium* and *Hard*, which will give the user different time windows to choose the correct position of the main slider and the correct insufflation pressure. With a **Sound** button he, or she, will be able to decide to hear, or not, the sound made by the playing Trombone. Finally, with the **Modality** setting, the user is able to choose the desired game mode.

# Three Hearts

The classic arcade game mode! The user gets only three chances to miss a note, and if he is capable of using well his own lives playing the notes on time, he. or she, will win the game!

# Survival

A challenge to the death. In this case, the user gets no chances to mess up. To win the game he, or she, has to be able to play the correct notes in the available time. No second shots!

# FreePlay

The most relaxed mode. This mode is for those who are still not ready for a real challenge, and just want to practice till they feel prepared. Basically, no matter if the user misses the note or not, the game will go on until the list of the notes he prepared is finished. Do you like to win safe?
